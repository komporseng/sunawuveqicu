Anthony Ramos and Jasmine Cephas Jones, the mega-talented original cast members of Hamilton who began dating at the start of the hit musical’s run, were engaged on Christmas Eve.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>“Thank you for saying yes to writing stories together for the rest of our lives,” Ramos wrote on Instagram. “I’m honored and Blessed to marry you.”</p><p>“My beloved Anthony, On Christmas Eve you got down on one knee and proposed to me in front of my favorite castle in Arundel that I used to visit all the time as a child,” said Jones on Instagram. “I love you beyond words and am so excited to continue this awesome journey with you.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Ramos made his Broadway debut originating the dual roles of John Laurens/Philip Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton. He appeared in a Kennedy Center staging of Miranda’s In the Heights as Usnavi, a role he will reprise in the upcoming screen adaptation. He made his major motion picture debut as Ramon in the 2018 remake of A Star Is Born.</p><h2>Jasmine Cephas Jones Say No To This</h2><p>Say no To this is a song by Jasmine Cephas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>How Much Does Jasmine Cephas Jones Weight?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>According to Healthy Celebs, She has a Weight of 52 Kgs.</p><h2>Jasmine Cephas Jones And Anthony Ramos Wedding</h2><p>“If you had asked me, ‘Did you always know you wanted to do this?,’ I would’ve said no,” Anthony Ramos tells me, scrolling through his phone. “Then my mom found this letter I wrote in the third grade.” He locates a picture of the note and starts reading from it: “If I had the opportunity to be on television, I would like to entertain all the people. I would sing some funny songs and some romantic songs. The tone would be high and low.” It seems nine-year-old Ramos had a sense of his future that not even the adult Ramos can quite comprehend.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>We are sitting inside a buzzing Park Slope diner, around the corner from Ramos’s Brooklyn apartment, where he lives with his fiancée, Jasmine Cephas Jones. The two met when they were performing as part of the original cast of Hamilton (Ramos played the dual roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton; Cephas Jones played Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds) and got engaged late last year. The proposal, which took place in front of Cephas Jones’s mother and grandmother, as well as friends like Cynthia Erivo, was videotaped and posted to YouTube for Hamilcouple fans. Still in the early stages of wedding planning, they’ve already figured out their priorities.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Jasmine and I both love music, so the DJ’s gotta be on point,” he tells me. “I want people sweating, suit jackets off, chancletas on.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Wearing a gray tee, denim shorts, and an old Calvin Klein Jeans baseball cap, Ramos has an easy charm—like the guy in your high school who’s friends with everyone. Our waiter greets him by name, asking if he wants his usual (steak and eggs). When he speaks, he is animated, with an accent that reveals his Brooklyn roots. (He once mentioned to Lin-Manuel Miranda, “You know, I talk too ghetto sometimes. I should change the way I talk.” Miranda told him to change nothing.)</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Ramos grew up not far from here, in the Hope Gardens housing development in Bushwick, living with his single mother, his older brother, and his younger sister. “We were pretty broke,” he tells me. “I asked my mom all the time, ‘Why do we eat rice, beans, and chicken every day?’ ” Ramos was a self-described lackluster student, but music was an escape; Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP spoke to him in particular: “It was a dude crying out through his music, and I was like, ‘Damn.’ ” In middle school, a teacher heard him sing and encouraged him and two of his classmates to start a group that would perform at school assemblies. Unable to afford college, Ramos toyed with the idea of joining the Navy before another teacher strong-armed him into completing an application to New York’s American Musical and Dramatic Academy and then secured him a free ride through the Seinfeld Scholarship Program. “In that moment, boom. My life was changed,” he says.</p><h2>Jasmine Cephas Jones As Peggy Schuyler</h2><p>She is best known for originating the dual roles of Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Jasmine Cephas Jones Blue Bloods</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Variety reports that “Blindspotting” will get a TV spinoff, starring Broadway star Jasmine Cephas Jones. She will reprise the role she played in the movie.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the series, Ashley (Jones), who was nipping at the heels of a middle class life in Oakland until Miles, her partner of 12 years and father of their son, is suddenly incarcerated, leaving her to navigate a chaotic and humorous existential crisis when she’s forced to move in with Miles’ mother and half-sister.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Her world is turned upside down while THE NEIGHBORHOOD goes inside out, and she must renegotiate her relationship with a town that is caught between two conflicting identities.</p><p>Fellow Hamilton alum Daveed Diggs, along with Rafael Casal, are attached to write and executive produce the series.</p><p>In addition to “Hamilton,” Cephas Jones starred Off Broadway in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (Atlantic Theater).

As a result, Ashley and her son Sean are soon forced to move in with Miles’ mother and half-sister, where Ashley will have to “navigate a chaotic and humorous existential crisis.” Just like in the 2018 movie, all of this takes place along the backdrop of a quickly-changing—and perhaps not for the better—Oakland.</p><p>Also like the movie—which made its debut at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival—the series will be written by “Blindspotting” stars Casal and Diggs. Casal and Diggs are set to executive produce along with “Blindspotting” producers Jess Calder and Keith Calder, Emily Gerson Saines, Ken Lee, and Tim Palen of Barnyard Projects. Lionsgate Television will also serve as producers of the series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In Chief Critic Eric Kohn’s review of “Blindspotting” for IndieWire he wrote:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p>“Miles (Casal) is at once the more reckless of the pair — he giddily brandishes a handgun for no good reason — even as he attempts to maintain a stable family life with his girlfriend (Jasmine Cephas Jones) and young child. Collin (Diggs) has yet to make amends with his ex (Janina Gavankar), who oversees the moving company while keeping her distance whenever she can.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><p>The women are unfortunately sidelined in a plot that has little to do with them; on the other hand, the male leads who dominate the movie aren’t dominant figures, either; responsibility eludes them at every turn. “Blindspotting” lingers on Collin’s rocky existence with a fascinating and unpredictable air. “</p><h2>Jasmine Cephas Jones&nbsp;Contacts</h2><h2>Related Biographies</h2><p>You may also like to read the&nbsp;<strong>Bio</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Career</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Family</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Relationship,&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Body measurements</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Net worth</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Achievements,</strong>&nbsp;and more about:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
