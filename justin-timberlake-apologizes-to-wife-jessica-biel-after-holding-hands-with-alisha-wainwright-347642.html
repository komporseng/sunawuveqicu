A few weeks ago I displayed a very strong lapse in judgment – but let me be very clear – nothing happened between me and my co-star. I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should’ve known better. This isn’t the example that I want to set for my son,’ the letter reads.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>He continued, writing that ‘I apologize to my amazing wife and my family for putting them through an embarrassing situation, and I’m focused on being the best husband and father that I can be.
