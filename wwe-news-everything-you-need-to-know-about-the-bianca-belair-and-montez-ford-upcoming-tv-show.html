In the interview via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful</a>, she shared her sentiments about doing a reality show with Ford. The 34-year-old expressed her excitement about the prospect of giving a glimpse of their lives outside the squared circle. However, she also admitted to being slightly nervous.</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>I will say that I used to have a little bit of downtime at home, but now I guess I won’t have any. The icing on the cake is that I get to do it with my husband, it’s exciting. I am nervous, I never thought that I’d be doing a reality type show but my husband is full of life and when I tell people that the person y’all see in the ring is the person I get at home. So now, I get to share that with the world. But I’m excited and I’m also nervous. We’re exposing ourselves and our family and pulling the curtain back a little bit and showing a balance between who we are in the ring but also outside of the ring. It’s exciting, it is exciting times.</pre>Bianca Belair on Comicbook<p>Furthermore, Belair stated that she never expected to do a reality show. However, she was thrilled to reveal that Ford is a vivacious person in real life. Thus, she looks forward to unveiling this aspect of his personality to the world. Bianca Belair and Montez Ford announced their engagement back in June 2017, and a year later the couple were married.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqaVrMBusdWeqbKsmJ67qHnYqKxmppWasW7Azmaip6enYq6ju9StZK2glWKvqq3NnJhmmpWhrqq%2BjJqlnWWdpLu1sdlmnaiqlGLCsa%2FOpqCnn12pw26%2Fx6iuaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-klein.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Klein - Bio, Age, Married, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
