There was something incredibly special about it to me, and the people here are incredibly honest, real, and good-humored."</p><p class=Fg>He went on to say that there was always something new to experience and discover in Vermont and that he woke every day grateful that he was able to see the view he could outside of his window.</p><p class=Fg>His love for Vermont remained firm to the very end. In fact, it seemed to last beyond his death. In the early hours of the morning after Treat passed away, a new post appeared on his Twitter timeline.</p><p class=Fg>The post was yet another video of his farm in Vermont. In the video, a tractor plowed through a field, and the caption <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Rtreatwilliams/status/1668398606083055616><u>read</u></a>:</p><p class=Fg>"What a real Vermonter does."</p><p class=Fg>The tweet left some fans wondering if Treat had passed on, as others <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Rtreatwilliams/status/1668398606083055616><u>said</u></a> the post-humous post was "eery."

When revealing how Treat passed on, it <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://deadline.com/2023/06/treat-williams-dies-actor-everwood-hair-1235415225/><u>read</u></a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It is with great sadness that we report that our beloved Treat Williams has passed away tonight in Dorset, Vermont, after a fatal motorcycle accident. As you can imagine, we are shocked and greatly bereaved at this time."</p><p class=Fg>The family then asked Treat's fans for their respect and privacy as they grappled with their grief. They also requested that Treat's fans keep him in their thoughts and prayers over the coming weeks and months.</p><p class=Fg>Treat was 71 when he passed away, and his agent, Barry McPherson, shared exactly what had happened to him. Treat had been riding his <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/treat-williams-dead-at-71-7511398><u>motorcycle</u></a> when he tried to make a left or right turn, and another driver hit him. The accident occurred at around 5 p.m. on Monday evening on Route 30 just north of Morse Hill Road.</p><p class=Fg>A helicopter airlifted Treat from the scene, but ultimately he did not pull through.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b7bba6fce494d6c66aa2aa2d824cfe23cf900befe7fad20b20c2818062191831.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Treat Williams at the Tribeca Talks After The Movie: By Sidney Lumet in 2016 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Investigators believed that the accident may have happened because the driver of the car that hit Treat did not see the motorcycle. Treat was the only one that was hurt in the accident. The investigation team was to return to the scene the following day to investigate the incident further.</p><p class=Fg>Treat had an excellent career that spanned more than four decades, and he had more than 120 acting credits. He also built a beautiful family with his wife and two children and enjoyed being in Vermont. McPherson said Treat had always been a pleasure to work with and that he was proud of his career.</p><p class=Fg>Treat and his family has remained relatively private throughout his career. Still, they have attended a few red-carpet events together to celebrate Treat's many roles in famous TV shows and movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5303e9c137415b9bb2bffa2aea1e3b1504a73434190fb25b9386a4b578314e5c.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Treat Williams at the Emmy Awards Show, September 8,1996 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Tributes to Treat have poured in from around the globe since the news of his passing broke earlier this week.
