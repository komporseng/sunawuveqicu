It's been 23 years since she first said goodbye to the popular girl group, and now, Halliwell is mother to a teenager, as hard as that may be to believe.</p><p>While Halliwell does not often post photos of her 15-year-old daughter <strong>Bluebell</strong>, she did share a few photos of her recently for her birthday, and it's easy to see the resemblance between the two.</p><p>Read on to see the pictures of Halliwell and Bluebell, and to find out more about the artist formerly known as Ginger Spice's family.</p><p><b>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Spice Girl Mel B's Lookalike Daughter, Who's a Model Now</a>.</b></p><p>On Bluebell's 15th birthday in May, Halliwell <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>posted a couple of current photos</a> of her and one of her in a glittery princess dress when she was younger.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"Happy 15th Birthday Bluebell!" the proud mom wrote in the Instagram caption. "Another year older, it's amazing to see you grow as a person, we are so proud of you!! We love you Blue."</p><p>Halliwell shares Bluebell with her ex, director and screenwriter <strong>Sacha Gervasi</strong>.</p><p>Halliwell is also mom to four-year-old son <strong>Montague&nbsp;</strong>(aka Monty), who she had with race car driver&nbsp;<strong>Christain Horner</strong>, her husband since 2015. She is also stepmom to Horner's seven-year-old daughter, <strong>Olivia</strong>, from a previous relationship with <strong>Beverley Allen</strong>.</p><p>"It has all been a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>huge change for Bluey</a>, after having me to herself for so long, suddenly having not just Christian in her life, but a little stepsister, who is just so sweet and now a baby brother," Halliwell told&nbsp;The Daily Mail&nbsp;in 2017 after Monty was born. "It's a lot for a young girl but she's a great kid, smart and funny with a big heart. I'm proud of her."</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Halliwell talked about her bond with Monty</a> in a 2017 interview with Hello! "He really is the sweetest, most affectionate baby—such a cuddler," she said. "I totally understand now that protective thing mums have with their sons; that deep-rooted feeling of 'That's my boy'. It is so lovely to have this little person who is half each of us. He's a pretty chilled baby for the most part, which he gets more from Christian, but then we'll encounter a bit of protest and I think, 'Ah, there's the Halliwell!'"</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Geri-Halliwell-Bluebell.jpg><p>In 2009, when Bluebell was only three, Halliwell spoke to Red magazine about being a mother. "As soon as you have a child, you get guilty," she said (<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>via People</a>). "I'm always thinking, 'Is that good enough? Am I doing it right?'"</p><p>She added, though, that she liked seeing the world as a child again through her daughter. "There is a part of me that is quite child-like," she said. "I love the innocence, the creativity; that gets so lost in the cynical world we live in."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Billy Joel's Daughters, Who Are 6 and 3, in Rare Photos</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/geri-halliwell-bluebell-1.jpg><p>While talking with&nbsp;<strong>Oprah Winfrey&nbsp;</strong>in a 2016 episode of Oprah:&nbsp;Where Are They Now?, Halliwell opened up about her <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>battle with bulimia</a>. "Throughout my 20s, I had bulimia. Even when I'd recovered from it, I had a distant relationship with food," she said (via Hello!). "I think one of the challenging aspects is the scrutiny being in the glare of the spotlight. I think I felt much more conscious of myself, my body weight. All the things that everybody normally goes through, but a heightened version."</p><p>In a 2020 episode of her YouTube series <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener external" class=class href=#>Rainbow Woman</a>, Halliwell talked about developing a healthy relationship with food for her daughter's sake while baking with her. "Food for me has been such an interesting subject so to find a healthy relationship has taken time," she said. "'I had always wanted a good relationship with food so my daughter would have it, so she wouldn't be like how I was when I was growing up—always on a diet and had no interest whatsoever."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Jennifer Grey's Teen Daughter, Who Looks Just Like Her</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmoJ2innqprculoLCdnKF6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rebeka-masarova-madre-marivi-and-padre-peter.html><span>←</span><span>Rebeka Masarova Madre Mariv And Padre Slovak Masarova: Familia Ethnicity</span></a>
