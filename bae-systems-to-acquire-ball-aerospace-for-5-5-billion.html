The U.S. government is now its largest customer.

BAE said the targeted completion date is in the first half of 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Vertical Research Partners, a financial advisory firm, said in a note to investors that news of the acquisition is no surprise as it had been rumored for the last couple of months,&nbsp;</p><p>“Ball gives BAE significantly more exposure to the growing government space market,” VRP said.</p><p>&nbsp;“The tricky part for BAE management remains ahead,” said the note from VRP. “Firstly we shall see what the regulatory response is from the U.S. Department of Justice, though the recent <a href=#>clearance of the Aerojet </a>transaction bodes well.”</p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroJawprrEsKpnm5%2BifKOtxGaqsqukmrq0edOoZJqboaq2s7GMm5ilpF2WsrO70qmYnJ1dm7yzeZRmbGaamaG5qrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./becky-g-mayores-bad-bunny-lyrics-english-translation.html><span>←</span><span>Becky G Mayores Lyrics English Translation</span></a>
