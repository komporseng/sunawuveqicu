The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Kansas City Chiefs</strong></a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tight end</a> seemingly referred to her when talking about his “girlfriend Kayla” in a Q&A video he took part in with WNBA player <strong>Chiney Ogqumike</strong>, which can be seen here, on Nov. 30, and even called her “the absolute best.” The comments came after Chiney asked him about who was on his Christmas list this year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“So obviously we’ve got the fam. My girlfriend Kayla. Kayla is definitely on the list,” he said while answering the question. “Always gotta do it big for Kayla.” Chiney then replied with some love for the brunette beauty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Travis-Kelce-Kayla-Nicole-Dating-Again-AP-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“By the way, I love her. We follow each other, sisters in sports, I’m here for her,” she gushed before Travis called her “the best.” “She’s the absolute best. She’s a big fan of yours as well, she mentioned it before we got on” he replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Travis’ admission about Kayla comes after he confirmed their breakup on Aug. 4. Just a few days before, on Aug. 1, he and his lady love <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unfollowed each other</a> on social media, which prompted speculation that their relationship was off. There were also rumors that Travis cheated on Kayla and that’s what caused the split, but the football player went on social media to set the record straight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Travis-Kelce-Kayla-Nicole-Dating-Again-AP-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“This is fake news…a lie…and not why Kayla and I broke up,” he wrote on Twitter in response to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tweet</a> claiming Kayla caught him with a woman named “Becky”. “Take all your hatred somewhere else please.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Travis and Kayla’s breakup came as quite a shock back in the summer because of how close they seemed. Since going public with their relationship in 2017, they often showcased their love for each other in various ways, including in funny TikTok videos and at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>football games</a>, especially at the last Super Bowl, which Travis and his team excitingly won. Regardless of what’s happened in the past, though, it’s great to see the lovebirds back together and getting ready for the holidays!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49qZq2qkau2tHnKnqOcnV2grrq4wGalopufobJursCcomasn5yytbTEq2SvoZSavHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./smart-gurlz-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Smart Gurlz Net Worth 2023: Founder Of Smartgurlz And After The Shark Tank Pitch, What Happened To S</span></a>
