Anniston's nipples seemed to be standing out through her dress as she accepted the award and delivered a heartfelt and emotional speech.</p><p>Her white floor-length satin dress hugged her figure and featured a gorgeous cowl neckline. "I spent the entire 90s forced to look at Jennifer Aniston’s diamond cutting nipples on Friends. I should not have to still be subjected to them in 2020," said a Twitter user, not quite happy with her outfit choice, referring to her character, Rachel Green, in the sitcom, 'Friends', whose nipples were often visible through her clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7c4c0137-7ae8-4c15-b272-a9811b4d4ce7.jpg><p>Another said, "Where’s the SAG award for Jennifer Anniston’s nipples?" A third Jen fan said, "Jennifer Aniston still having her nipples out in 2020 is what makes her an icon."</p><p>Some fans seemed to be too distracted. "What did Jennifer Aniston say in her #SAGAwards speech? Her nipples were poking me in the eyes," one fan said. Another fan joked, "Jennifer Aniston’s nipples better be up for Best Supporting Actress at the 2021."</p><p>Some fans, however, were enraged that people were talking about her nipples when she just won such a prestigious award. "Can everyone SHUT THE F*** UP about Jennifer Aniston's nipples? good lord yes they exist now shhh," tweeted a fan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/efb3e164-1476-4706-bac8-33f404e9e302.jpg><p>Another fan appreciated her addition to the Free the Nipple movement. "I love Jennifer Aniston’s years of commitment to freeing the nipple," one fan tweeted. Another said, "One Million Moms are probably keeling over in agony and pain over Jennifer Aniston’s nipples right now."</p><p>Either way, she looked absolutely smashing!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5GceqLDwKubrGViZX9xedOwoK2slad6s7HAnKusZaSkequxzaegn52iYq6vusisq6imXaO2sbzLnqpmpZ%2Bnu6q6xmaqoaenYsSquoysp56dk50%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jared-polis-salary-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jared Polis salary and net worth</span></a>
