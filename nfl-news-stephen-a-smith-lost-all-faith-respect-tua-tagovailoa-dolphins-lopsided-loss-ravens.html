After their blowout loss against the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Baltimore Ravens</a>, fans and analysts have been raising a lot of questions. A few days back analyst <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Wright had the claim that he would be in shock</a> if the team managed to win a single game in the postseason. A few days later, it was Stephen A. Smith who had a jibe at the team for their time at the gridiron.</p><p>In one of the episodes of the show ‘First Take,’ the analysts seemed frustrated at the team. He said:</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>I've lost all faith and all respect for the Miami Dolphins," Smith said. "I'm so disgusted with the Miami Dolphins. They make me sick. They really, really do. To watch them go on the road and wet the bed as many times as they have this year. ... I see a** kickings on their dockets. And that is what disgusts me.</pre>Stephen A. Smith on First Take<p>This is not the first time, the analyst has had a jibe at the Dolphins. He was seen disgraced during the game between the Dolphins and the Ravens and took to X. He wrote that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was done with the Dolphins</a> after seeing them going to effortless. He seemed annoyed to see McDaniel and Co. having no moment at the game against the Ravens.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Miami Dolphins have struggled on a lot of occasions. They had a poor time against the teams that had winning records. The Dolphins only managed to beat the Cowboys and that too in the dying seconds of the game. The team also lost the No. 1 conference spot in the AFC and will have no home advantage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stephen-a-smith-took-a-jibe-at-miami-dolphins-tyreek-hill><strong>Stephen A. Smith took a jibe at Miami Dolphins’ Tyreek Hill</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Tyreek Hill</strong> </a>has been a star throughout his season. He has received tons of appreciation from the players, analysts, and others. Nonetheless, for the first time, he faced something harsh from an analyst. Smith did not hesitate to question Hill for his poor show against the Ravens. ‘</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_COM_20231018_1043_33_1142.jpg><p>Smith said on ESPN’s first take:</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>To have us rave about Mike McDaniels, the way that we have people talking about the boy genius that he is supposed to be, to look at the greatness of Tyreek Hill, who spent the vast majority of this season literally as an MVP candidate. But we can point to last week against Baltimore [and] the Philadelphia game... where he literally drops touchdown passes.</pre>Stephen A.Smith on First Take<p>Hill had an awful show against the Ravens. He only had six receives for 76 yards. In addition, the WR dropped a pass which was a pretty easy catch for a player like him. The incomplete TD pass had an impact on the game.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBuv9Oep6GdnmKubr%2FMoquhZZykwLV5wKWjZp6RnsGpedGeqqmdk6l6tcHAZquan5%2Brrqq4zppknaecpbWqutJmo6ioo56xprCMpaasq12nrrexzaxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justdustin.html><span>←</span><span>JustDustin Bio, Age, Height, Single, Net Worth, Career, Facts</span></a>
