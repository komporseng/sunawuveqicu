1980, he was offered the job of freelance business agent Victor Newman on the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless.&nbsp;At first, the job was for a 26-week run.&nbsp;His character held the darling of his half, and turned out to be so common that the character turned into a hate-loving villain, and his deal was expanded.</span></p><p><span>Braeden won a Daytime Emmy for his work in 1998, and in February 2017 he celebrated his 37th anniversary with the show.&nbsp;In 2020, the show designated Braeden’s 40th commemoration as on-screen Victor.</span></p><p><span>In October 2009, Braeden

three-year deal and would stay with the cleaner, and agreed to take a pay cut, which was the first issue.</span></p><h2><span>ERIC BRAEDEN CAREER</span></h2><p><span>Braeden amassed numerous

credit under his original name.</span></p><p><span>His starring work in the film Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), was when he previously made that big appearance by the name of Eric Braeden.&nbsp;Lew Wasserman of Universal Pictures revealed to him that no one would be allowed to act in an American film if he had a German name.&nbsp;After many ideas, he took the name Braeden from his old neighborhood of Bredenbek.</span></p><p><span>Other film appearances in the 1970s incorporated the work of Dr. Otto Hasslein in Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), and that of self-important but impressive racing vehicle driver Bruno von Stickle in 1977’s Herbie Goes to Monte by Walt Disney.&nbsp;Carl.&nbsp;Throughout the 1970s, he was also a guest on an assortment of
