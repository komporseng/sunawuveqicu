And I thought it was so geniusly written and genuinely funny. It was the first of its kind. So for us to be part of something that was so legendary, we had to bring our A game. They had to make sure the writing was good, they had to pick the best cast for it.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The former&nbsp;Power star wasn’t the only one to allude to the criticism and skepticism that preceded the movie’s January 13 release during&nbsp;DX‘s exclusive conversation with the cast.</p><p>“We’ve been hearing things about what they thought the movie was gonna be but we never allowed that to transition into set work,” DC Young Fly revealed. “We never allowed none of the bad energy to come on set. We already knew what we was facing we just got together and was like ‘whatever happens we’re going to do it together. And not only are we going to do it together, let’s just have fun. We’ll worry about the extra stuff later on.</p><p>He added: “But as we can see now, the results: this is a great movie. Not only does it pay homage to the older generation, but it’s refreshing. It gives us a new light on what House Party would be in today’s time.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/Kid-Cudi-House-Party-250x142.jpeg alt="‘House Party’ Stars Say Kid Cudi Is “Incredible” In New Reboot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>‘House Party’ Stars Say Kid Cudi Is “Incredible” In New Reboot</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 12, 2023</p></a></span></p><p>While maintaining the original&nbsp;House Party‘s general premise, the remake introduces a few updated plot points. British actor Tosin Cole plays Damon, a down-on-his-luck promoter who, along with partner and best friend Kevin, is trying to come up with a quick money scheme after losing their jobs as house cleaners.</p><p>The plan they land on is an outlandish house party at the home of their final cleaning client: none other than LeBron James, who makes a cameo in the film.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>With Cole also having been a fan of the Kid-N-Play originals, Jacob Latimore says he and his co-star didn’t even attempt to rehearse the iconic dance named after the duo and popularized by the first&nbsp;House Party.</p><p>“We didn’t want to do too much rehearsing because we wanted to keep it raw and fresh,” the&nbsp;Chi-Town actor explained. “We didn’t want it to feel to ‘5,6, 7 8’ vibes. I think we do a great job of showing how they kick it by themselves and when they get to the party they get to do the moves they’ve always been practicing.”</p><p>House Party is in theaters now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mifqK2jmnqxrdGtsGabkajBbr%2FHmqmeq12btrO%2F02acp5ufqru1sdGsZKShlGK7brzLmrA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strahinja-jokic.html><span>←</span><span>Strahinja Jokic</span></a>
