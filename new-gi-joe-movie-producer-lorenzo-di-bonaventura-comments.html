<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>'G.I. Joe' Producer Says Theyre Working on the Next Movie [Exclusive]</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>As the <a href=#><strong>Transformers</strong></a> franchise has transformed itself into a blockbuster giant, one of its Saturday morning cartoon contemporaries has deeply struggled to find the same success - <a href=#><strong>G.I. Joe</strong></a>. The future of the classic action figure-turned-animated favorite is still awaiting its next move after a slew of big-screen failures culminating in a reboot with 2021's <a href=#><strong>Snake Eyes</strong></a>. Speaking to Collider's <strong>Steve Weintrau</strong><strong>b</strong> for <a href=#><strong>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</strong></a>, producer <strong>Lorenzo di Bonaventura</strong> said that despite the struggles, conversations are going on behind the scenes to bring the "Real American Hero" back to theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snake Eyes was meant to launch a new era of G.I. Joe films with the much-delayed <strong>G.I. Joe: Ever Vigilant</strong> moved back to make room for the reboot. However, with the <a href=#>struggles of the spinoff</a> and Ever Vigilant still up in the air, there's room to wonder whether the franchise would be better suited for a return to television. Back in 2021, Hasbro and Paramount even <a href=#>had a series in the works</a> centered on Lady Jaye that would link back to the larger world established in the films.</p><p>As di Bonaventura notes, however, that never came to fruition. For now, it seems Paramount is forgoing the two-pronged approach and is instead focused on bringing G.I. Joe back in some form using what was written for their pilot to inform a future film. He explained:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We actually developed a pilot with Amazon. This was before Paramount+, just as Paramount+ was coming in. It didn't pan out. We are in a lot of conversations about what to do with it as a film, and so I would have to say, most likely you're going to see that come to fruition. How soon is always impossible to say. For a long time, there were no active conversations. There's a lot going on right now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Channing-Tatum-GI-Joe.jpg><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:</span></p><p><a href=#>Larry Hama's 'G.I.

Joe's Theatrical Reputation Is Far From Stellar</h2><p>Whatever the plans are for a G.I. Joe film, it'll have a difficult time swaying audiences considering every previous attempt has fallen flat. 2009's <strong>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</strong> has been a frequent target for criticism ever since its release, earning the ire of not just fans and critics but also the film's stars. <strong>Channing Tatum</strong>, who was only in the film out of contractual obligation, spoke out about how much he detested the films despite his love for the G.I. Joe brand as a whole, even <a href=#>begging to be killed off early on</a> in <strong>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</strong>. That sequel, too, was largely panned even if the addition of <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> helped it fare better than its predecessor. The poor effects of a bad reputation showed in Snake Eyes, which reportedly lost Paramount money after grossing just over $40 million against an $88 million budget, not to mention hefty international marketing costs.</p><p>Stay tuned here at Collider for more as progress continues toward bringing G.I. Joe back to theaters. For the time being, di Bonaventura is focused on Transformers: Rise of the Beasts which releases on June 9. Check out the trailer below and head <a href=#>over here to hear di Bonaventura reveal how Rise of the Beasts is different from the Michael Bay movies</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ku6bDjKCgZqKfmnquu9WinGaooqSxtq%2FEq2Slp6Kau7u7jJ2gZpqfo663sc2trKuZXZi8rrnEp6usZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-was-wack-100-arrested-his-prison-picture-on-instagram-makes-fans-curious.html><span>←</span><span>Why Was Wack 100 Arrested?
