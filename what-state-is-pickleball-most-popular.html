With over 36.5 million players in 2022, it is no surprise that many are curious about which states have embraced the sport the most. Based on search interest, residents in Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Florida are the most pickleball-obsessed.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Florida, in particular, has the most courts and clubs of any U.S. state, with a whopping 1,191 and 26, respectively. Arizona comes in as a close second, followed by Utah. Washington and Oregon also have solid <a href=#>pickleball</a> scenes. Joining a local pickleball club can enhance gameplay and provide opportunities for competition.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The sport of <a href=#>pickleball</a> has become so popular that even celebrities like LeBron James and Tom Brady have joined in playing the sport. Cities across the country are building more pickleball courts to accommodate the growing demand, and the most <a href=#>pickleball</a>-obsessed cities per capita are Miami, FL; Orlando, FL; and Atlanta, GA.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Pickleball's</a> popularity is attributed to its age-friendliness and accessibility.

South Dakota ranks lowest in terms of court availability and pickleball community. However, the sport has been growing in popularity across the country, and even in South Dakota, players are finding ways to enjoy the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The methodology for ranking states considered factors such as the number of facilities and courts. States were given scores that determined their overall ranking. Utah, Idaho, Arizona, and Hawaii were ranked as some of the top states for pickleball, based on various factors such as the number of players, the number of courts, and the number of pickleball clubs.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>while <a href=#>pickleball</a> is growing in popularity across the country, Florida has emerged as the top pickleball destination, with the most courts and clubs of any U.S. state. Arizona, Utah, and other states are also embracing the sport, with thriving <a href=#>pickleball</a> scenes and enthusiastic players. Pickleball's age-friendliness and accessibility make it an appealing sport for players of all ages and skill levels, and as more and more people discover its joys, the sport will likely continue to grow in popularity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXajBosDEZqCsZaCesKy4xJuYpaRdory0wIyppqmtnJa%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julann-griffin.html><span>←</span><span>Julann Griffin</span></a>
