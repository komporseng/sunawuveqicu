This refers to energy, rather than a person’s sex or gender, meaning you could be a woman but have a ‘divine gender’ that is masculine.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jeff and Shaleia claim their close connection with God means they can confirm a person’s true ‘divine gender’, even if it is not one they identify with.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couple told Vanity Fair that members who ‘discover a new divine gender’ are never pressured to change their outward appearance. But the publication notes that ‘many of them do; starting with their names, pronouns, dress, and hair.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One transgender man spoke positively of discovering his ‘divine gender’ was masculine after being guided by members of the community and his coaches.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-28ffee5c57abd32d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/07/11/37717422-9118315-image-a-5_1610018000260.jpg height=338 width=634 alt="Jeff and Shaleia vehemently deny any allegations of wrongdoing and claim the attacks are part of a conspiracy theory to 'destroy' the Twin Flames Universe.

He added to Vanity Fair: ‘It wasn’t forced on me in any way.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However others believe members are encouraged to outwardly adopt their ‘divine gender’. Ten ex-members told the publication the ‘Twin Flames Universe is coercing vulnerable people who have never experienced gender dysphoria to transition’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One ex-member said: ‘If those people in there are happy, I hope so. But I just think it’s all too likely that indoctrination made them believe that they were trans when they were f*****g fine before.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All current members disagreed, saying that no one has pressured them to transform anything about their bodies or lives. Jeff and Shaleia rejected the idea that they coerce people to change their gender.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jeff also referred to himself as ‘Father Christ’ and said Shaleia is ‘Mother Christ’, positioning them as the undisputed leaders of the group with an intimate connection to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He later justifying the statement by saying it was a reflection of the belief that everyone is a divine being but added he is also the ‘Second Coming’ of Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former members speaking to Vice leveled a range of accusations against the Twin Flames Universe and accused Jeff and Shaleia of building a ‘cult empire’ that exploited its members.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ex-members and parents of current members claimed followers were encouraged to cut off communication with their families, an isolation tactic that is common in cults.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked for comment by Vice, Jeff and Shaleia denied they are running a cult. ‘A cult is a (sic) organization of abuse that systematically takes from and harms its members to enrich its founder,’ Jeff said. ‘We created an organization of love and harmony which heals and enriches everyone in it and everyone who is connected to anyone in it.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Vanity Fair, Jeff and Shaleia also ‘filed two lawsuits that named&nbsp;<span>seven former Twin Flames Universe members and one family member as defendants, variously accusing them of defamation, false promotion, unfair competition, and additional charges. Among other things, the complaints allege that their negative accounts of Twin Flames Universe online or in the Vice&nbsp;</span>story are false, cooked up to make the spiritual community look bad and to steal their clients, drive people away, and promote the ex-members’ businesses.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>MailOnline has contacted the Twin Flames Universe for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmaPAqrDEZquhnV2pxKq6jJ%2BjmqWVqHq2usivnKurlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gavin-schilling-get-comfortable-case.html><span>←</span><span>Gavin Schilling Get Comfortable Case</span></a>
