Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy railed against the GOP after the Supreme Court struck down the federal right to abortion on Friday, calling the reversal of Roe v. Wade “pure insanity” while declaring that it’s “too dangerous” to vote Republican.
Colloquially known as “El Presidente,” the head of the bro-centric sports media empire has remade himself into something of a “right-leaning populist champion” in recent years.
