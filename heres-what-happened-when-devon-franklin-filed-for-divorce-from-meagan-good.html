DeVon also fiercely defended Meagan against criticism from haters who questioned her Christianity.</p><p>“The whole idea of he’s a preacher and she’s this, it blew my mind how many people had an opinion when God is the only one who directs our story. So, he knows where our story is going to go,” DeVon previously toldvia S2S Magazine.</p><p>“They didn’t see how she fit or how I fit in her script, but I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute. When the last time you went before God? Before you gave me this note, before you posted that comment, did you pray?’”</p><p>Added Meagan in her own defense:</p><p>“People think that I just got saved when I met DeVon or the year before, but I’ve been saved since I was 12. I’ve been loving the Lord since I was a little girl,” Meagan said. “The woman that God already made me—flaws and all—is the woman that DeVon fell in love with, not the woman I became after I met him.”</p><p>Why do you think Meagan and DeVon are dunzo?
