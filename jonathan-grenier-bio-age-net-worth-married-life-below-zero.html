His Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>National Geographic’s hit TV show, Life Below Zero: North Territories, has finally returned for its 2nd season. This season will follow the day-to-day trials of the original cast plus a newcomer as they battle wildlife and weather in the unforgiving environments of Northern Canada. Jonathan Grenier from Kuujjuaq, Nunavik in northern Quebec joined the original cast members, <a href=#>Becky Broderick</a>, Bentley Kakekayash, Kim Pasche, and Pierre-Yves Duc, in the second installation of the show.</p><p>Learn about Jonathan Grenier’s Life Below Zero: Northern Territories stint, his age, net worth, married life, and more in the wiki article below.</p><h3><strong>Jonathan Grenier On Life Below Zero: Northern Territories</strong></h3><p>Based on the Emmy-winning format Life Below Zero, the 2nd season of Life Below Zero: Northern Territories is filmed across the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Northern Ontario, and Nunavik in Northern Quebec in chilly weather conditions and gives its viewers a look into the daily lives of some Canadians who live off-the-grid in some of the harshest regions on Earth.</p><p>Hailing from Kuujjuaq, Quebec, Nunavik, Jonathan is an avid hunter, fisherman, and proud son of the North, according to blueantmedia.com. He spends every leisure period of his life either land hunting or fishing to provide for his family. Reportedly, Jonathan has two boats–one for inland rivers and another, a larger 24-foot North River boat for the harsher and unpredictable sea area. In a single season, Jonathan hunts many things including black bear, caribou, muskox, ptarmigan, geese, and fox.</p><p>As a man of mixed Inuit and French Canadian heritage, Jonathan speaks French and English fluently and has a working knowledge of Inuktitut. A father of two, Jonathan is determined to teach his sons how to live off the land in a traditional Inuit way.</p><h3><strong>Jonathan Grenier Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to Jonathan Grenier’s LinkedIn handle, he is an Advisor to the Institutions at Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services. He has also been serving Chrono Aviation Tingijuk, an aircraft charter company based in Kuujjuaq, and flying out of Montreal, Quebec City, and Rimouski, as a President since February 2014.</p><p>Jonathan joined Nunavik Pituvvik Management in October 2013 as its president and has been working there ever since.</p><p>From April 2003 to July 2013, Jonathan was the Captain of Air Inuit. Furthermore, he once held a job as a Municipal Manager of the Northern Village of Kuujjuaq.</p><p>Talking about his education, Jonathan studied Aviation Management at John Abbott College. Life Below Zero: Northern Territories star completed his high school studies at National Sports Academy.</p><p>Moreover, Jonathan has an ice-hockey background. He participated in the 2014 Northern Hockey Challenge final as a goalkeeper of the team Kuujuaq. Although they lost the final to Iqaluit Iceman with a score of 5-8, Jonathan took a lot of positives at the end of the game.</p><p>“We had a bit of a rough time in the round robin but the guys are getting to know each other a bit more. We haven’t played together much this year,” Jonathan said.</p><h3><strong>Is Jonathan Grenier Married?</strong></h3><p>Jonathan Grenier is married to his wife named Lally PB. As per Jonathan’s Facebook, the pair tied the wedding knots on September 18, 2021. A lot of Jonathan’s Facebook friends congratulated the couple on their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jonathan-Grenier1-300x261.png><p>Jonathan also shared on Facebook that the two were in a relationship since February 5, 2018.</p><p>Life Below Zero: Northern Territories star Jonathan has two kids, both sons. However, we doubt his kids were born out of Lally’s womb. On February 26, 2019, Jonathan wished his elder son Kalluk a happy 7th birthday. Given that Jonathan and Lally are together only since 2018, it is only logical to think that Jonathan’s kids come from his previous relationship.</p><p>That being said, we know nothing about his previous partner/s.</p><p>In March 2021, Jonathan and his wife found out that they had major problems with their house and unfortunately they had to relocate to Jonathan’s parents’ place for their safety.
