She joined in the show with Gerrie Labuschagne, Jackson Mawhinney, Obi Nnadi, and <a href=#>Olga Bednarska</a>. The other original contestants were Jazlyn Holloway, Beaux Raymond, Georgia Hassarati, Harry Johnson, Holly Scarfone, Jaz Holloway, Nathan Soan Mingomezulu, Patrick Mullen, <a href=#>Patrick Mullen</a>, <a href=#>Izzy Fairthorne</a>, and Truth.</p><p>If you’re unaware of the premise of the show, “Too Hot To Handle” featured original ten contestants.</p><p>The casts spent four weeks on a tropical island in Turks and Caicos. Like the previous two seasons, the rules for the show remain the same. If there is any s*xual act involved, the money will be deducted. However, the one thing that has been changed this time, is the prize money which has been doubled. The winner pockets $200 thousand.</p><p>Since the stake is high casts this season has to rethink before they act making it much more interesting for fans of the show to watch the casts struggle with their impulses.</p><h3><strong>Are Brianna Giscombe And Obi Nnadi Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Brianna Giscombe arrived in the “Too Hot To Handle” as if she came to the show to save Obi Nnadi from the despair he felt after the girl he first linked with shut him down. The reason was his height and his body weight. But, Obi and Nathan caught Brianna’s eyes when she arrived in Episode 6 because of Obi’s personality that set him apart from Nathan and the rest of the men in the show.</p><p>So, Brianna was willing to set herself aside for a one-on-one conversation when Obi pulled her on her very first day in the villa.</p><p>Obi admitted that he was chasing prospects that came his way, particularly since he wanted to “vibe” with someone and thought Brianna might be that person. Thankfully, she responded by saying she was anxious to get to know him better because they’re both “beautiful people” who had previously established a level of trust that allowed them to chat about anything. As a result, Obi was understandably upset and annoyed when Brianna chose Nathan as her date the next morning. However, everything seemed to calm down for them after a short while, and they got closer.</p><p>Obi and Brianna never explicitly mentioned their feelings, but their actions revealed that they sincerely cared about each other. They did everything from sticking together at parties to sharing a bed and laughing about whenever they could, illustrating that all someone needs is a connection to grow into a more empowered human – whether platonic, passionate or somewhere in between on the experimental side.</p><p>After all, while Obi recognized that his experiences will make him wiser, Brianna claimed that she would no longer be scared to embrace her affectionate side. While we can’t say for sure whether Obi and Brianna are still together or not as of writing, we do know that they both appear quite satisfied with their current situation.</p><p>About Obi, he was born in Nigeria but has been living in Toronto. He described himself as a guy in the club as soon as he arrives you can see him and his boys they are all posted up. Obi likes to think of himself as the leader of the pack and super outgoing and charismatic.</p><h3><strong>Brianna Giscombe </strong><strong>Height</strong></h3><p>Talking about height, Brianna Giscombe stands tall to the height of 5 feet 7 inches.</p><h3><strong>Brianna Giscombe </strong><strong>Family</strong></h3><p>Brianna Giscombe was born to her father Vernon Giscombe and her mother Diane Draper.
