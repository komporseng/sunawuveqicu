Rebecca Grossman, an affluent socialite, and philanthropist from Los Angeles pleaded not guilty in the hit-and-run that killed two youngsters in 2020.</p><p>Rebecca Grossman was cited as stating in a Fox 11 report:</p><p>“I was driving when my airbag deployed unexpectedly. Someone should inform me about those kids. I’ve heard that youngsters were involved.”</p><p>Grossman was driving home after dinner in Westlake Village, Los Angeles, when the event happened. She was reportedly traveling at 81 mph at the time. According to the video of the occurrence and the inquiry, Grossman may have been drunk. Rebecca is a co-founder of the Grossman Burn Foundation, which seeks to establish long-term partnerships for the complete treatment, care, and assistance of burn survivors and their families in the United States and across the globe.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Now that she’s been ordered to stand trial for murder, Rebecca Grossman shakes up her defense team, with Texas attorney Tony Buzbee at the helm. He’s been called “a big, mean, ambitious, tenacious, fire-breathing Texas trial lawyer.” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#acornnewspaper</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#crime</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#courts</a></p><p>— Scott Steepleton (@ScottSteepleton) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 31, 2022</a></p><h2>Rebecca Grossman’s attorney blames the deaths of two young boys on a poorly designated and illuminated crosswalk.</h2><p>Rebecca Grossman appeared in court on Friday, June 3 for a deadly hit-and-run on September 29, 2020. Grossman was speeding in her Mercedes when she hit 11-year-old Mark and 9-year-old Jacob Iskander. Grossman allegedly pulled one of the boys 100 feet on the hood of her vehicle after striking them. When she applied the brakes, the child collapsed. Instead of checking on the child, Grossman raced over his corpse again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rebecca-Grossma-2.jpg alt="Rebecca Grossma" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nancy Iskander, the victim’s mother, alleged that she attempted to stop Grossman but it was too late.&nbsp;Grossman’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, has alleged that the Iskander brothers were on “roller skates and a skateboard,” making it difficult for Grossman to apply the brakes on time.</p><p>Buzbee had this to say about it:</p><p>“The prosecution’s continuing determination on turning this into a murder case by charging my client, a cornerstone of this community, with murder is nothing more than an obvious attempt to get her to plead. Such gamesmanship stymies progress in this critical case. We will not allow Rebecca to be intimidated in this manner.”</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“The city was constantly urged to improve and secure the crossing. My client never spotted those tiny boys that night because of the darkness, lack of illumination, and the color of their attire.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rebecca-Grossma-1-1.jpg alt="Rebecca Grossma" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Buzbee blamed their deaths on a crossing that was “poorly marked, unprotected, and dark.”&nbsp;Rebecca Grossman is accused of two counts of criminal murder, two counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, and one case of felony hit-and-run driving resulting in death. Meanwhile, former Major League Baseball pitcher Erikson has simply been charged with careless driving. According to reports, despite the gravity of the allegations, she was freed on bail two days later.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipnpqVmLCiecarpqyrnZZ6sbjEnWSnp6RitLa1y62wZqGeYsGpsYxrZ2toXZ22tXnAp5tmqqWjeqKvwqKbnqakYsGprdNmoqKknJqxbsDWqGSkoZSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jensen-steel.html><span>←</span><span>Jensen Steel - Bio, Age, Net Worth, In Relation, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
