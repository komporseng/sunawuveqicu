When seven years old she was cast in Bradford May’s television film “Trouble Shooters: Trapped Beneath the Earth” (1993). Soon, she appeared in the main cast of her first feature film “A Little Princess” (1995) directed by Alfonso Cuarón. Since this auspicious beginning, which gave her net worth a considerable boost, Camille has starred in over 20 feature films. The most notable have been “Practical Magic”(1999), which brought her a nomination for a Young Artist Award – Best Supporting Actress, and “The Ballad of Jack and Rose”(2005_ for which she was nominated for a Gotham – Breakthrough Award, Regardless, Camille’s net worth built steadily with each film she had a part in.</p><p>In addition to the afore-mentioned films, Camilla Belle has landed the lead role in several other films, including “Back to the Secret Garden” (2001) directed by Michael Tuchner, “The Quiet” (2005) directed by Jamie Babbit, “When a Stranger Calls” (2006) directed by <a href=#>Simon West</a>, “10,000 BC” (2008) directed, co-produced and co-written by <a href=#>Roland Emmerich</a>, “Adrift” (2009) directed by Heitor Dhalia, and “Cavemen” (2014) directed and produced by Herschel Faber.

Moreover, Belle has appeared not only in feature films but also television films which have also helped to increase Camilla Belle’s net worth as well as her popularity.</p><p>The roles Camille has landed in television films include “Replacing Dad” (1999) which brought her another nomination, for Best TV Supporting Actress, “Rip Girls” (2000) – nominated for Best Young Supporting Actress, and “Back to the Secret Garden” (2001).
