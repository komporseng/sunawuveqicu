The beloved Happy Days actress suddenly passed away and there has been a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>massive outpouring of grief for her</a> since. In remembrance of Erin, we’ve gathered some of her best moments as her Happy Days character Joanie Cunningham that’ll warm your heart.</p><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><p id=content-paragraph-3>Obviously you cannot talk about Joanie without Chachi! Erin’s character even had her own spinoff show for a season with <strong>Scott Baio’s</strong>&nbsp;character. Joanie finally agreed to go on a date with Chachi, after rejecting him several times in season 7. He got so excited that he accidentally burned down the burger joint Arnold’s!&nbsp;Another classic moment for Joanie and Chachi happened in the season 8 premiere. The young couple tried to sneak off to a Beach Boys concert in Chicago, but in true comedic fashion Chachi’s car breaks down. They ended up stranded at a motel&nbsp;together!</p><h3><a href=#>Click Here For Photos Of Erin</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>The pair&nbsp;had a super heartbreaking moment in season 11 when they broke up. Joanie was super into her college life and did not have the time to spend with Chachi so he was really upset. She realized that she couldn’t compromise with him on this so Chachi decided they had to split. In a funnier season 4 episode, Joanie got Fonzie played by <strong>Henry Winkler</strong> to team up with to humiliate the head cheerleader who booted her from the squad. He nicknamed her “Shortcake,” which became a classic. Fonzie had a fight for the strength to make it through Joanie’s dance marathon after having to push his motorcycle home after it stalled. Erin’s delightful Joanie will be definitely be missed!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you have a favorite Joanie moment?
