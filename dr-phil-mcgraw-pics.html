In 1968, Tulsa lost to the University of Houston, 100-6, one of the most lopsided college football losses ever. Phil would find better success off the field. After transferring to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas, Phil graduated with a B.A. in psychology. He attained his Masters in experimental psychology and PhD in clinical psychology at the University of North Texas. From there, he began a private practice, but soon grew dissatisfied. He later started the “Pathways” self-help seminars.</p><p>Shortly after launching “Pathways,” Phil co-founded the Courtroom Sciences, Inc. company, at trial consulting firm. It was through CSI that Phil connected with Oprah Winfrey in the mid-1990s, after she was sued by disgruntled Texas ranchers who claimed she defamed the beef industry. Phil’s team coached Oprah’s defense and they won the case. She had him on the show afterwards, which led to a recurring segment, “Tuesdays with Dr. Phil.” He would get his own show in 2002.</p><p>As of 2020, Dr. Phil is not licensed to practice psychology in any state within the USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLGzec%2BhoKVlnZi0s63WZqeim6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-simon.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Simon Net Worth $200 Million</span></a>
