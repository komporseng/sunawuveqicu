<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Who Is Nikki Hasselbarth? Her Age, Job</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When ABC’s supernatural sitcom Not Dead Yet premiered on 8 February 2023, it quickly gathered one of the largest fanbases the network has seen in years. Viewers especially seem to love how in every episode they got to see their favorite star’s guest star as a ghost. For instance, the up-and-coming actor Langston Kerman with TV series credits such as Insecure and Bless This Mess, featured as a ghost in Episode 5. So, in the rest of the writing, we shall tell you about his wife Nikki Hasselbarth, her age, job, life as an actor’s wife, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Nikki Hasselbarth, Langston Kerman Wife</strong></h3><p>Langston, who played a deceased doctor “Dr. BooBoo” in&nbsp;Not Dead Yet, married beautiful Nikki Hasselbarth on 6 October 2019. “Yesterday I married the love of my life and it’s the happiest I’ve ever felt.

Laughing, Langston said he bought her a liter of petrol and it all started from there. Next, they gave away the ‘how they “hook up”‘ story. After the first meeting, they had fun for a week or so and got quite close. But, soon Nikki started to think the long distance to be a dealbreaker considering where he lived and where she lived. Langston somehow persuaded her to just keep talking and get to each other. But, within 2 months he said it was just him talking. Nikki in her defense said that she was busy working long hours and taking care of her mother.</p><p>Eventually, Langston anyway convinced Nikki to come to one of his college gigs and that is when they started dating. When Langston was asked what it is about Nikki that made him so persistent, he said he found her to be very pretty and smart and yet very kind.</p><h3><strong>Do Nikki Hasselbarth And Langston Kerman Have Kids Yet?</strong></h3><p>On 8 May 2022, Langston Kerman wished his wife Mother’s Day calling her “the lady who matters most” to him and his baby. “Our baby goes out in public chewing a giant piece of an alphabet floor mat, but I don’t blame you for that. We love you all the same”, he also teased afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nikki-hasselbarth-bio-age-job-langston-kerman-wife-2023-1-300x256.jpg><p>So, yes.
