Overall, this particular perf was pretty and intimate. She looked lovely in her blinged-out necklace and white dress, which channeled the '50s in and had bows down the back.</p><p>All the chatter about her being unable to sing live is shot to hell with this sweet performance. When she finished, Del Rey murmured something about wishing that she could be in the crowd with her fans. She clearly struggles with being in the spotlight and on stage, but it's not hampering her. She's improving. She sings like she does on record without incorporating any flash or flourishes. That just means Del Rey is going against the pop music grain.</p><p><strong>Watch Lana Del Rey Perform 'Video Games'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kuaK6wGabnqRdp7K6ecWapaxlnKTDpnnVopuep12crq6x0mannqqWpL%2Burc2cnGarkaN6p77Ap5qiq5OkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roberta-raffel.html><span>←</span><span>Roberta Raffel Bio, Net Worth, Height, Married, Career, Facts</span></a>
