Several women had come out with sexual claims against Woods that year.</p><p>Elizabeth showed up to support those women’s voices. Whether it’s her talents in Hollywood or her humanitarian efforts, she does it in such a way that the words seem intangible.</p><p>She is a perfectionist since she has a five-million-dollar net worth, according to Celebrity Net Worth. She also has a gorgeous home in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Among all of Elizabeth’s gorgeous decorations, some of her followers have speculated if she has undergone plastic surgery. The suspicions arose because the actress appeared to never age.</p><p>Her ethereal beauty, though, continues to captivate her devotees. To get down to the subject, yeah, she had some work done on her face. In 1996, she had a facelift, upper and lower eyelid surgery, and laser resurfacing around her mouth to enhance her appearance.</p><p>Throughout her career in show business, the actress has reached new heights, with more to come in the coming months. But, even now, Elizabeth Perkins, 61, is a role model for millions of people for a reason.</p><h2>Husband of Elizabeth Perkins</h2><p>Elizabeth was raised in a loving and caring household as the youngest of two sisters, Susan and Karen. Her spouse, cinematographer Julio Macat, completes her picture-perfect family.</p><p>The vows they exchanged, the commitments they made to one other as they walked down the aisle in 2000, is still intact after more than two decades of marriage.</p><p>In 1994, during the production of ‘Miracle on 34th Street,’ Elizabeth and her husband, Julio, laid eyes on each other for the first time. Their love story, which began years ago, has not lost its essence.</p><p>Elizabeth celebrated her 24th Valentine’s Day with the love of her life, Julio, this year. She captioned a lovely post, ‘Happy Valentines Day love of my life.’</p><p><strong>‘It’s been 24 years and counting.’</strong></p><p>Julio might be the love of her life right now, but she’d had her fair share of heartbreaks before him. She initially walked down the aisle with her ex-husband, Terry Kinney, in 1984.</p><p>Terry was one of the Steppenwolf theatrical company’s founders. According to accounts, Elizabeth fell in love with him at first sight. Unfortunately, the relationship lasted only four years before the actress and her ex-husband split up.</p><p>They divorced legally in 1988, after four years of marriage. In 1991, the actress exchanged hearts with Maurice Phillips, whom she dated until 1992.</p><p>In terms of children, the actress has one daughter, Hannah Jo Phillips, who married in 2021. After all of her trials and breakups, the actress eventually healed herself and met her present husband, Julio, in 1994.</p><p>And the spark of love remains in the eyes that met years ago.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Stacey Silva | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Stacey Silva is an entertainer and vocalist who is known for her work on Mega Man Die toward the End, White T, and Cyanide and Happiness Minis.
